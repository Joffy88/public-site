              <p>
                Until recently I was the Editor of a dedicated PC gaming and
                hardware website. Over the years Iâ€™d worked closely with our
                development team and gained a broad perspective of the workings
                of the site, and trying it for myself confirmed this was the
                move for me.
              </p>
              <p>
                I began learning a bit more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                before deciding to dive in head-first and teaching myself the
                ins and outs of web development. I am a highly motivated,
                self-starting developer who is adaptable and able to learn new
                things quickly, together with a strong eye for detail.
